          Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where the objective is to clear a
          grid without detonating hidden mines. The game consists of a grid of
          covered squares, some of which contain mines.

            Click on any square to begin. If you click on a mine, you lose
            instantly. Don't worry!! Just play again üòÅ.

            (including diagonals). If a cell doesn't have a number, it means
            that it has no bombs adjacent to it.

          Using right-click (on computer), you can flag suspected mines.. üö©
          This can help you to detect them, but be careful, a wrong marked mine
          can lead you to mistakes!
